### Development Journal of Reincarnation ☯️

Project started 20 October 2023, during Bolzano Game Jam in Castel Mareccio.
The team was initially composed by Fabius and Aaron, we met there Gino, game dev.

After the final presentation we kept pushing new releases.
In the beta release we had no strong chrachters, just one animation, no lights.
We just imported the AR Geospacial data we were dealing with for the Google Hackathon.

The new version is planned for the Halloween Release, so the deadline is in one week.
This is what we implemented and the next steps we are currently discussing and testing with friends.
