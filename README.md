## **Overview** 📖:

"Reincarnation" is a third-person exploration game developed during the Game Ground Festival's Game Jam in October 2023, set in the picturesque town of Bolzano, with Castel Mareccio as its focal point. Rooted in deep spiritual concepts, the game offers players a journey across time, connecting past, present, and the future, all while unraveling mysteries and understanding the essence of time and identity.

## Main Plots:

**Present**: Sayd, a young individual, wakes up in Bolzano's skatepark with no memory of the recent past. Surrounded by people partying and skating, Sayd must piece together the events leading up to this moment. As the player navigates through Bolzano, they'll interact with various NPCs, uncovering bits and pieces of Sayd's life and the mystery of the memory blackout.

**Past**: Transitioning to the past, players find themselves as the queen of Castel Mareccio. This chapter is filled with royal duties, managing the kingdom, and ensuring the prosperity of Bolzano. Players will face challenges, make decisions that impact the kingdom, and immerse themselves in the rich history of the region.

**Future**: In a distant future, consciousness transcends human limitations. The player becomes a robot with human-like sentience. Bolzano has evolved, and amidst its futuristic landscape, the player will explore themes of identity, consciousness, and the relationship between humans and technology.
